# PROJECT 3 - MULTIPLE DISEASE DETECTION SYSTEM
This project has been done as a part of my internship program at Nexus Info. This is the third and final project of my internship, where I utilized machine learning and Streamlit to create a robust disease detection system. The internship was conducted remotely, allowing me to collaborate with professionals and enhance my skills in a virtual environment.

## Introduction
The Multiple Disease Detection System is designed to detect Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and heart disease from medical images using advanced deep learning techniques. The system aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing an automated tool that can quickly and accurately diagnose these conditions, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of medical diagnoses. The project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to analyze medical data and identify potential diseases, offering a reliable solution for early detection and treatment planning. The application was deployed using Streamlit, an open-source app framework, which allows for the creation of interactive and shareable web applications for machine learning and data science.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.9 or higher
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:

3. Run the desired disease prediction script:
- For Parkinson's Disease:
  ```
  python parkinsons_prediction.py
  ```
- For Diabetes:
  ```
  python diabetes_prediction.py
  ```
- For Heart Disease:
  ```
  python heart_disease_prediction.py
  ```

4. Follow the prompts to input data for prediction.

## File Structure
- `parkinsons_prediction.py`: Script for predicting Parkinson's Disease.
- `diabetes_prediction.py`: Script for predicting Diabetes.
- `heart_disease_prediction.py`: Script for predicting Heart Disease.
- `Dataset/`: Directory containing the datasets for each disease.
- `README.md`: Instructions and information about the project.

## Notes
- Ensure correct paths to dataset files are provided in the scripts.
- Trained models are saved as `.sav` files for future use.

## Execution
- Open the terminal and run the command as streamlit run app.py
