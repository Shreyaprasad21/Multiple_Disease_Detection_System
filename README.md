# Multiple Disease Prediction

This repository contains Python scripts for predicting multiple diseases using machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression. Three diseases are covered: Parkinson's Disease, Diabetes, and Heart Disease.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.9 or higher
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:

3. Run the desired disease prediction script:
- For Parkinson's Disease:
  ```
  python parkinsons_prediction.py
  ```
- For Diabetes:
  ```
  python diabetes_prediction.py
  ```
- For Heart Disease:
  ```
  python heart_disease_prediction.py
  ```

4. Follow the prompts to input data for prediction.

## File Structure
- `parkinsons_prediction.py`: Script for predicting Parkinson's Disease.
- `diabetes_prediction.py`: Script for predicting Diabetes.
- `heart_disease_prediction.py`: Script for predicting Heart Disease.
- `Dataset/`: Directory containing the datasets for each disease.
- `README.md`: Instructions and information about the project.

## Notes
- Ensure correct paths to dataset files are provided in the scripts.
- Trained models are saved as `.sav` files for future use.

## Execution
- Open the terminal and run the command as streamlit run app.py
